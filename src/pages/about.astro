      <p>
        Hi! I'm Luca, a {age} year old developer born and raised in Salta, Argentina.
        My main passion is the world of programming, specializing in full stack â€”
        frontend heavy. Since I was very young I discovered my fascination for technology
        and at the age of 9 I had already created my first web page and even hosted
        a Habbo server with Java and MySQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        But programming is not my only passion. Music is another of my great
        motivations in life. I play the piano since I was a kid and I'm
        currently part of several bands in my city, playing national and
        international rock, jazz and math rock. We enjoy playing concerts in
        different theaters, cafes and bars.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I am most passionate about and motivates me is constant personal
        and professional growth, living under Luis Alberto Spinetta's "tomorrow
        is better" philosophy. Believing that everything can improve drives me
        to strive and overcome my limits. To be where I am today, 5 years ago
        was a dream, and I hope to continue accomplishing more goals in the near
        future.
      </p>
